# Kaggle-30-days-of-ML
I just completed 30 days of Machine Learning from Kaggle. The code here is my best attempt in its ML competition.

While I am only one of the top 37% participants, my score is only 0.003 different from the best one, which is not bad given that this is my first time to join Kaggle competition.
